## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Victor â€” a Data Consultant with a deep love for clean pipelines and messy business problems.

My journey with data started earlier than expected.

Back in 8th grade, I found myself fascinated by the logic of Excel spreadsheets. I had no idea that those simple formulas would one day lead me into modern data engineering.

Originally, data wasnâ€™t part of the plan â€” I was on track to build bridges.

I actually come from a Civil Engineering background [@ESTP Paris]([url](https://www.estp.fr/en))), and for a while, that was the path.

But over time, I realised how much I enjoyed turning raw numbers into real business insights, and I pivoted toward data through a double degree ([@emlyon]([url](https://em-lyon.com/en))).

That passion only grew stronger with every project I tackled. Today, I help companies make their data work for them; not the other way around.

Over the past 5 years, Iâ€™ve worked as a freelance Data Consultant with companies like [Decathlon]([url](https://www.decathlon.com/)), [Artefact]([url](https://www.artefact.com/)), and [Auchan]([url](https://www.auchan-retail.com/en/who-we-are/)), in roles ranging from Data Analyst to Lead Data Engineer.

I now specialize in building** modern, reliable, and scalable data platforms** that drive real business outcomes â€” whether through dbt modeling, Airflow orchestration, or full-stack systems in GCP, Snowflake, or whatever tools youâ€™re using.

I work best with teams whoâ€™ve adopted the modern data stack but need help moving from 'this should work' to 'this delivers'.

If that sounds like you â€” Iâ€™d love to talk.

Youâ€™ll usually find me on [LinkedIn]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/)) or on [my blog]([url](https://vvaneecloo.ghost.io/)), where I share what Iâ€™m learning and working on.
