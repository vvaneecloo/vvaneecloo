## Hi there 👋

I’m Victor — a Data Consultant with a deep love for clean pipelines and messy business problems.

## 🧠 What I Do

I specialize in building **modern, reliable, and scalable data platforms** that drive real business outcomes — whether through dbt modeling, Airflow orchestration, or full-stack systems in GCP, Snowflake, or whatever tools you’re using.

I work best with teams who’ve adopted the **modern data stack** but need help moving from '_this should work_' to '_this delivers_'.
