## 👋 Hi there

I’m Victor, a Freelance Data Consultant with a deep love for **clean code & pipelines** and **messy business problems**.

<br/>

## 🧠 What I Do

I specialize in building **modern, reliable, and scalable data platforms** that drive real business outcomes — whether through dbt modeling, Airflow orchestration, or full-stack systems in GCP, Snowflake, or whatever tools you’re using.

I work best with teams who’ve adopted the **modern data stack** but need help moving from '_this should work_' to '_this delivers_'.

I specialize in building **modern, reliable, and scalable data platforms** that drive real business outcomes.

Over the past 5 years, I’ve worked with:

- [Decathlon](https://www.decathlon.com/)
- [Artefact](https://www.artefact.com/)
- [Auchan](https://www.auchan-retail.com/en/who-we-are/)
- [Saint-Maclou](https://ensemble.saint-maclou.com/notre-adn/)

#### 🎯 Key Results I’ve Delivered for Clients

- Cut pipeline costs by **40%** by migrating from **dbt Cloud** to **dbt Core + Airflow** and **optimizing runs** via **microbatching** and **selective testing**,
- Saved **> 4,500+ engineering hours/year** with a **custom Airflow library** (alerting, Tableau orchestration, dbt test surfacing),
- Restructured legacy models using **star schema** + **Snowflake**, and introduced **scalable testing + documentation standards**,
- Trained **35+ data team members** (engineers, analysts, scientists) and led **dbt adoption through hands-on coaching**.
